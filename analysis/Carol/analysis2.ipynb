    "### Guest Experience & Satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Guest experience and satisfaction are crucial for Airbnb hosts since positive reviews can increase booking rates and listing visibility. Many travellers incorporate other guest reviews into their decision-making process when evaluating accommodation options. This research will explore key factors influencing guest satisfaction, such as pricing, host responsiveness, and amenities. By identifying patterns in high-rated listings, hosts can refine their offerings to improve guest experience and secure better reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Research Questions\n",
    "- Q1. How do listing features like the number of amenities or instant booking availability impact guest satisfaction ratings? \n",
    "- Q2. What is the relationship between the different ratings and the price of listings for different property types?\n",
    "- Q3. Which amenities are most frequently associated with higher guest ratings in Airbnb listings?"

    "1. The heatmap shows which features correlate with higher guest satisfaction by using a colour gradient. This is useful for spotting trends quickly, as darker or more intense colours indicate stronger correlations. However, it aggregates data into bins, which can lead to a loss of detail about individual listings. If too many features are included, the heatmap can also be cluttered and difficult to interpret. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The scatter plot shows how a single feature impacts guest satisfaction, while also adding a second feature through colour encoding. It is useful for detecting outliers and identifying trends. However, scatter plots can be overwhelming if there are too many data points, leading to overplotting. Additionally, it does not provide a holistic view of multiple features at once, as it only examines the relationship between two at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The boxplot is useful for visualizing the distribution of guest satisfaction ratings for different features. However, one of its main disadvantages is that it does not capture correlations between multiple features simultaneously. Additionally, the boxplot may be misleading if sample sizes for different features vary significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Choice** \n",
    "\n",
    "The heatmap was chosen as the final visualization because it effectively conveys the relationship between multiple features and guest satisfaction ratings intuitively. By structuring the data in a grid format and using a colour gradient, users can recognize trends and patterns easily. High-impact features are easily distinguishable due to the contrast in colour saturation, drawing attention to the most relevant insights in the dataset. "
