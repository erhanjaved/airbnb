The [Inside Airbnb dataset](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) is a comprehensive collection of Airbnb listings in many major cities around the world. For our project, we will focus on the New York City dataset, which includes 377,784 records with each row representing an individual listing. The dataset features 75 columns that cover essential details like listing name, host identity verification, neighbourhood, room type, price per night, and availability. It also includes review metrics like the number of reviews, last review date, and ratings to provide insights into customer experiences. This dataset is useful for analyzing Airbnb market dynamics, host behaviours, pricing strategies, and customer preferences in New York City. 

The dataset is publicly available on Inside Airbnb under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The data is scraped from publicly available information on the Airbnb site. Afterwards, it is analyzed, cleansed, and aggregated by the collaborators of the project. The dataset is updated quarterly and includes information for the last twelve months. The version that we are using for our project was last updated on March 1, 2025. 


## Topic & Interest

Our group is particularly interested in understanding the impact of Airbnb listings on the housing market and tourism economy in New York City. With Airbnb becoming a dominant player in the short-term rental market, it is essential to analyze how its presence affects rental prices, availability of long-term housing, and neighborhood demographics. We aim to explore patterns in pricing, host behaviors, and customer experiences to identify trends in demand and supply. Additionally, we will investigate whether there are correlations between high Airbnb activity and rising rental costs in specific boroughs. By leveraging data-driven insights, our project seeks to provide a clearer understanding of the role Airbnb plays in New York Cityâ€™s housing and tourism sectors. The findings may contribute to discussions on regulatory measures, urban planning, and economic policies related to short-term rentals.
