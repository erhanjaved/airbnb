The [Inside Airbnb dataset](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) is a comprehensive collection of Airbnb listings in many major cities around the world. For our project, we will focus on the New York City dataset, which includes 37,784 records with each row representing an individual listing. The dataset features 75 columns that cover essential details like listing name, host identity verification, neighbourhood, room type, price per night, and availability. It also includes review metrics like the number of reviews, last review date, and ratings to provide insights into customer experiences. This dataset is useful for analyzing Airbnb market dynamics, host behaviours, pricing strategies, and customer preferences in New York City. 

The dataset is publicly available on Inside Airbnb under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. The data is scraped from publicly available information on the Airbnb site. Afterwards, it is analyzed, cleansed, and aggregated by the collaborators of the project. The dataset is updated quarterly and includes information for the last twelve months. The version that we are using for our project was last updated on March 1, 2025. 


## Topic & Interest

Our group is interested in analyzing the factors that contribute to Airbnb success in New York City, particularly focusing on host strategies, guest satisfaction, pricing trends, and the competitive landscape of short-term rentals. Many of us have personally experienced how reviews influence booking decisions and want to explore the patterns behind positive guest experiences. By examining factors such as host verification, multiple listings, and instant booking, we aim to understand how these elements impact booking frequency, pricing, and overall competitiveness.

We are also intrigued by the role Airbnb plays in urban housing dynamics and its potential effects on rental markets. Through data visualization and statistical analysis, we will uncover trends in pricing, guest ratings, and location-based factors that influence Airbnb performance. This project provides an opportunity to apply data cleaning, organization, and visualization skills to extract meaningful insights.

Our intended audience includes Airbnb hosts and short-term rental operators. By analyzing location, pricing strategies, host behavior, and guest satisfaction factors, we aim to provide insights that help hosts optimize their listings, refine pricing strategies, and improve guest experiences. Understanding how neighborhood, room type, cancellation policies, and review ratings influence pricing and booking frequency can help hosts stay competitive in the dynamic short-term rental market. Additionally, our findings may inform policymakers on the impact of Airbnb on the housing market.
