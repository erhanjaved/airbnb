    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 Dataset Description \n",
    "\n",
    "The Global Road Accidents dataset is a large collection of road accident data from different countries around the world. It includes 132,000 records with each row representing a road accident occurrence. There are 30 columns/features on important details like accident severity, weather conditions, number of vehicles, driver characteristics (e.g. age, gender, and alcohol levels), road type, speed limits, emergency response time, and even economic losses. This dataset is suitable for analyzing traffic accidents and the factors that contribute to them, which can be useful for predicting outcomes like severity and fatalities for future incidents. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday1/global-road-accidents-dataset/data)\n",
    " under the MIT license. It is mentioned in the documentation that the data is simulated from twelve reports, but does not specify which ones. Likely sources include official reports, government transportation agencies, and traffic safety studies. The dataset is updated annually on Kaggle and was last updated in February 2025.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Team Members \n",
    "\n",
    "**Carol Zhang**: I am a fifth-year Commerce student with a minor in Data Science. I am interested in the Global Road Accidents dataset because road safety is an important issue worldwide that has impacted almost everyone I know, including myself. I would like to explore how data can help us identify patterns and risk factors to motivate better decision-making. This could potentially prevent or reduce the severity of accidents in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Ayuho Negishi**: I am a fifth-year Psychology student minoring in Data Science. My academic background has made me very interested in understanding human behaviour. I am especially curious how driver-related factors (e.g., fatigue, alcohol levels) might reveal broader cultural and behavioural patterns. Although the dataset does not fully capture all the details of cultural context, I hope to find trends in these variables that suggest how social factors affect driving behaviour and accident outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Erhan Asad Javed**: I’m a fourth-year Mathematics student with a minor in Data Science. This dataset is particularly interesting to me because it allows me to apply my practical skills in data cleaning and organization to create effective visualizations on a topic that is critically important to modern road safety. My goal is to uncover underlying trends and identify key risk factors associated with car accidents. Through this analysis, I hope to create greater self-awareness and contribute to raising public awareness about road safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aaron Ma**: I’m a 3rd year Computer Science student. This dataset is particularly interesting to me because road accidents are things that always occur around us, and are more likely to occur compared to things like flying. I’d love to explore the data to be able to identify patterns and trends surrounding the more overlooked attributes such as taking into account response time, vehicle condition, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4 Intended Audience \n",
    "\n",
    "This project's primary target audience includes policy makers, transportation agencies, and urban planners, who play a critical role in shaping road safety regulations and infrastructure. By analyzing factors such as driver behaviour, road conditions, emergency response efficiency, and socioeconomic impacts, this project aims to provide actionable insights to improve road safety policies. The findings will help identify high-risk areas for prioritization, optimize resource allocation for emergency response services, and reduce the economic burden of road accidents by minimizing fatalities, medical costs, and property damage. By doing so, this project seeks to enhance road safety, reduce accidents, and ultimately save lives. \n",
