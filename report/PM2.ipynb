    "### 1.1 Dataset Description\n",
    "The Inside Airbnb dataset is a comprehensive collection of Airbnb listings in many major cities around the world. For our project, we will focus on the New York City dataset, which includes 377,784 records with each row representing an individual listing. The dataset features 75 columns that cover essential details like listing name, host identity verification, neighbourhood, room type, price per night, and availability. It also includes review metrics like the number of reviews, last review date, and ratings to provide insights into customer experiences. This dataset is useful for analyzing Airbnb market dynamics, host behaviours, pricing strategies, and customer preferences in New York City. "

    "**Carol Zhang**: I am a fifth-year Commerce student with a minor in Data Science. I am interested in this dataset because Airbnb is a major player in the travel industry. Through my travels on exchange, I came to realize how important guest satisfaction is and how other reviews heavily influenced my decision-making when choosing accommodation. I want to better understand the factors that lead to positive guest experiences and make wiser choices the next time I travel.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Ayuho Negishi**: I am a fifth-year Psychology student minoring in Data Science. My academic background has made me very interested in understanding human behaviour. I am especially curious how host strategies on Airbnb, like being a verified host, having multiple listings, or offering instant booking, influence guest satisfaction, booking frequency, and pricing. I want to find patterns in how these host behaviours affect the success of listings and the overall competitiveness in the Airbnb market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Erhan Asad Javed**: I'm a fourth-year Mathematics student with a minor in Data Science. This dataset is particularly interesting to me because it allows me to apply my practical skills in data cleaning, organization, and visualization to explore patterns in short-term rentals and urban housing dynamics. My goal is to uncover underlying trends in Airbnb pricing, host behaviour, guest satisfaction, and location-based factors affecting listings in New York City. Through this analysis, I aim to provide insights that can help travellers make informed decisions, hosts optimize their strategies, and policymakers better understand Airbnb’s impact on the housing market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aaron Ma**: I’m a 3rd year Computer Science student. This dataset is particularly interesting to me because of the prevalence of AirBnB in a very common activity, travel. As someone who heavily relies on public reviews, I would like to see how hosts can leverage their tools such as being verified and having high response time, to gain an advantage against others in such a competitive space. I would like to better understand how Airbnb hosts garner advantages over one another through means that are not as obvious such as price. "

    "The intended audience for this project is Airbnb hosts and short-term rental operators. By analyzing location, pricing strategies, host behaviour, and guest satisfaction factors, this project aims to provide hosts with valuable insights into how they can optimize their listings for better performance. Hosts will learn how elements such as neighbourhood, room type, cancellation policies, and review ratings influence pricing and booking frequency. This information will help them refine their strategies, improve guest experiences, and increase bookings to stay competitive in a dynamic market.\n"
